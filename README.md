# **Purpose**

This project aims to create an application that allows people to donate their unwanted items to the needy ones. People would usually donate items to organizations who then distribute them to the needy, but this app allows you to directly get in touch and donate to them

# **Rationale**

 There are many websites/apps out there which are solely for selling second-hand items to people for a sum of money. However, there are very few or no websites/apps which are for the purpose of donating unwanted products to the needy or people who cannot afford them.

# **Current knowledge of everyone**

We are currently learning how to use flutter and dart for the frontend code, while we know more about the backend coding process as it uses python.

# **Why our own idea**

 Through this app, we can help the people that are in need through creating a platform for donation, and we also know what we are supposed to do better.
