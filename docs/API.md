# Summary

The Donut API is organized around REST. The API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes authentication, and verbs.

# Authentication

A token is an authorization key that cannot be tampered with. It is generated by the server using a secret key, sent to and stored by the user in their local storage. Like in the case of cookies, the user sends this token to the server with every new request, so that the server can verify its signature and authorize the requests.

# Errors

Donut uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Donut's servers (these should be really rare).

## HTTP status code summary

- 200 - OK

  Everything worked as expected.

- 400 - Bad Request

- 401 - Unauthorized

  N/A

- 403 - Forbidden
